Minus CO2 Challenge is a competition organized by the European Association of Engineers and Geoscientists (EAGE) and Equinor in London. The challenge is a form of project to propose a Plan of Development (PoD) for net-zero CO2 emission development of Norne Oil Field in North Sea. I led a team of 4 students (1 undergraduate Geophysics, 2 undergraduates Petroleum Engineering, and 1 PhD candidate Geophysics) to participate in this challenge. We implemented the geophysics workflow of seismic interpretation with attribute analysis, reservoir static and dynamic modelling, and economic simulation. Our team secured in one of 9 Best Team.
