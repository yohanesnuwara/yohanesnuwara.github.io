Three DAS optical fiber cables were installed down-hole; two cables are straight cables in a 250-meter well and 880-meter well, and one cable is helical in the 250-meter well. Figure below shows the vertical section of our installed cables and Silixa iDAS interrogator in Chiba. Notice there is a difference between cables installed in the 250-meter and 880-meter well. For the straight (STC) and helical cables (HWC) in the 250-meter well, they were installed along the cement (thus denoted as STC250 and HWC250). For the straight cable in the 880-meter well, it was installed behind casing (thus denoted as HWC880).
