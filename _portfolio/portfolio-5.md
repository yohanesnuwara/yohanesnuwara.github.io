Images (orthophotos) are retrieved from the FTP server and outputs are sent to FTP. 

## Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

This is where inputs and outputs are stored. All metadata about each individual plantation area, called as *Petak*, are stored in the database. Examples of input metadata are captured date of UAV acquisition, stratum (plant species and age), province or district locations, area, land type, and many more. While each computer vision use case runs, it retrieves these input metadata from database. After it is completed, output is stored to database also as metadata. Some examples of output metadata are number of tree count, tree stocking percentage, weed percentage, and blankspot percentage. The database also serves as a geodatabase where the outputs such as geolocated tree coordinates and grid polygons are stored.
