## Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

This is where inputs and outputs are stored. All metadata about each individual plantation area, called as *Petak*, are stored in the database. Examples of input metadata are captured date of UAV acquisition, stratum (plant species and age), province or district locations, area, land type, and many more. While each computer vision use case runs, it retrieves these input metadata from database. After it is completed, output metadata will be stored to database.
