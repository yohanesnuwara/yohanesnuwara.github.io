Gundih Field is a gas field located in Cepu Block in East Java, Indonesia. As much as 70 MMSCFD of gas has been produced from the Kujung carbonate formation since 2001. The gas has 21% of CO2 composition, therefore as much as 15 MMSCFD of CO2 is also produced. In 2012, Gundih CCS Pilot Project was formed to carry out a pilot operation to inject the CO2 into the subsurface.
