excerpt: "Tree count"

This project started when Sinarmas Forestry, our sister company, upgraded their remote sensing imaging from fixed-wing to quadcopter drone UAVs, around late 2021. This new quadcopter technology was tested in 3 districts in Riau where the *Eucalyptus pellita* plantations with two-month age are located. My company, Asia Pulp and Paper, had developed tree count models on variety of species and ages (we call it Stratum) based on Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN object detection models, mostly on the fixed-wing images. When these models were tested on the new quadcopter images, the accuracy (F1-score) was not so good.
