> üë®‚Äçüíª [**DASLab**](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/daslab) is an open-source software (written in Python) for digital signal processing and analysis of DAS fiber-optic data that I developed for this research project. 

This project was done in RITE during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2021. I was involved in the CO2 Storage Group led by Dr. Ziqiu Xue. In August, I was given the opportunity to [present this research]() in a workshop organized by the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) in USA. It was expected that our research could set a new direction for utilizing DAS to monitor seismic activities in Japan.
