Drilling break is an issue in oil field. This occurs when the rate of drilling penetration (ROP) suddenly drops, for example, from 36 meter/hour to 7 meter/hour, which causes financial loss. This may be caused by incorrectly controlling the Rotation Per Minute (RPM) and Weight On Bit (WOB) of the drillbit during drilling activity. When encountering different lithologies, for example sandstone and shale, drilling engineers may not have enough knowledge to keep the ROP. That is why we need to estimate the appropriate RPM and WOB to avoid the ROP from sudden break. We can combine machine learning and optimization to solve this problem. 

In this work, I used an open-source data from SPE.
