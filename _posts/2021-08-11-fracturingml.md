In unconventional oilfield, fracturing is the only way to extract the oil from the subsurface. Designing fracturing parameter such as number of clusters per stage is critical to contribute to its success. A cluster is a set of perforations shot into the casing and repeated over a number of intervals or spacing. The group of clusters then form the stage that will be stimulated with the proppant. One stage may consist of as little as 1 to more than 15 clusters. Usually, frac engineer develops numerical model to design the fracturing. However, as complexity in the formation rises, a numerical model can be insufficient. Therefore, data-driven modeling can be useful.
