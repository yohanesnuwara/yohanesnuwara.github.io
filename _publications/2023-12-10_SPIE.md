This work proposed the implementation of distributed data parallelism (DDP) and automatic mixed precision (AMP) to minimize the memory usage and optimizing usability of GPUs while improving the accuracy of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model in classifying earth terrains from satellite images. 

In this research, I had collaboration with ..., and also a geospatial data scientist, Gregory Olivierre, from OmegaCrop
