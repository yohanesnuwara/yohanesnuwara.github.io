Sealing capacity is a critical consideration in CO 2 sequestration. The question of how much CO2 is held by the structure could be answered if we fully understood its geological capacity. The Equivalent Grain Size (EGS) Method was introduced as one of the tools to evaluate the sealing capacity of the oil or gas traps (Sawamura and Nakayama, 2005 Nakayama, 2019). The previous researches have discussed the mechanism of oil or gas field development in which the content of the trap, either oil or gas depends on the top seal capacity assuming segregation of oil and gas has occurred inside the trap. Recently, according to Nakayama (2019), the same fashion of mechanism should occur in the Gas-CO2 system, thus the same theory can be also applied to the CO2-rich field. In this study, as an extension of this idea, the authors further discuss how much amount of CO 2 could be kept in a subsurface reservoir as storage and the maximum pressure to be injected without leaking The field under this study is located in the East Java Basin in Indonesia.
