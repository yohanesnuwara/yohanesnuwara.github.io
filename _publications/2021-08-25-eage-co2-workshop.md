This paper discusses our proposed methodology that we (Dr. [Kazuo Nakayama](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kazuo-Nakayama) in FGI Tokyo and my colleague Kevyn Augusta) developed to evaluate the capacity of seal rock for CCS using the Equivalent Grain Size (EGS) method. Using relation between seal porosity and pore throat size, the EGS method assumes hydrodynamic equilibrium of CO2-gas mixed fluids to calculate each column height in the carbonate reef structure and maximum pressure allowed for CO2 injection.
