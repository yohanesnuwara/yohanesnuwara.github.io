This work proposed a different approach of predicting compressional (P) and shear (S) wave sonic log response for petroleum subsurface characterization using genetic programming approach that produces a set of explainable mathematical equations related to different logs as features

In this research project, I collaborated with 2 professors from Curtin University Sarawak, Malaysia (Dr. Wong Wei Kitt and Dr. Filbert H. Juwono).
