This paper presents a novel methodology for the integration of multiple geophysical methods (rock physics modeling, time-lapse seismic modeling, and geomechanical analysis) for the purpose of monitoring Carbon Capture and Storage in a carbonate reef reservoir. Case study presented is in Gundih Field, East Java, Indonesia.
